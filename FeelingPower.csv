Feeling of Power
Isaac Asimov
Jehan Shuman was used to dealing with the men in authority on long-embattled earth.
He was only a civilian but he originated programming patterns that resulted
in self-directing war computers of the highest sort. Generals, consequently
listened to him. Heads of congressional committees too.
There was one of each in the special lounge of New Pentagon. General Weider
was space-burned and had a small mouth puckered almost into a cipher.
He smoked Denebian tobacco with the air of one whose patriotism was so notorious,
he could be allowed such liberties.
Shuman, tall, distinguished, and Programmer-first-class, faced them fearlessly.
He said, "This, gentlemen, is Myron Aub."
"The one with the unusual gift that you discovered quite by accident,"
said Congressman Brant placidly. "Ah." He inspected the little man with the
egg-bald head with amiable curiosity.
The little man, in return, twisted the fingers of his hands anxiously.
He had never been near such great men before. He was only an aging low-grade
technician who had long ago failed all tests designed to smoke out the gifted
ones among mankind and had settled into the rut of unskilled labor. There was
just this hobby of his that the great Programmer had found out about and was
now making such a frightening fuss over.
General Weider said, "I find this atmosphere of mystery childish."
"You won't in a moment," said Shuman. "This is not something we can leak to
the firstcomer. Aub!" There was something imperative about his manner of
biting off that one-syllable name, but then he was a great Programmer speaking
to a mere technician. "Aub! How much is nine times seven?"
Aub hesitated a moment. His pale eyes glimmered with a feeble anxiety.
"Sixty-three," he said.
Congressman Brant lifted his eyebrows. "Is that right?"
"Check it for yourself, Congressman."
The congressman took out his pocket computer, nudged the milled edges twice,
looked at its face as it lay there in the palm of his hand, and put it back.
He said, "Is this the gift you brought us here to demonstrate. An illusionist?"
"More than that, sir. Aub has memorized a few operations and with them he
computes on paper."
"A paper computer?" said the general. He looked pained.
